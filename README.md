# Selective Laser Sintering Printer 

#### Project Specifications

*Brief description:* Modelled a 2-DOF selective laser sintering printer system in Simulink and then designed and implemented a PID controller.

*Languages:* MATLAB

*Software:* MATLAB, Simulink

*Report:* See the SLS Printer Slides Part 1 and 2 for a full project description. 

#### [Part 1 Slides](https://github.com/hannahvsawiuk/SLS-3D-Printer/blob/master/SLS%20Printer%20Slides%20Part%201.pdf)
#### Slides Part 1 Overview
Explains how the models of the dynamics of the robotic 2-DOF wrist were computed. The dynamics of the robotic wrist includes all electronics, motors and mechanisms of the wrist.

#### [Part 2 Slides](https://github.com/hannahvsawiuk/SLS-3D-Printer/blob/master/SLS%20Printer%20Slides%20Part%202.pdf)
#### Slides Part 2 Overview
Explains how the best motors for each joint in the system were selected. Then, the design and implementation of a PID controller for the system to minimize build error without burning any motors is explained.
